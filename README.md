## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the application of a band-stop filter for audio processing. The goal is to filter out specific frequency ranges from audio signals to reduce or eliminate unwanted noise. The repository contains MATLAB code for adding noise to audio files and applying the band-stop filter.

## Project Overview
1.	To get the results of a Band-reject filter by eliminating higher frequency components from an input audio.
2.	To understand how the band-reject filter shapes the spectrum of the input signal based on the filter characteristics.
3.	To compare the graphs of input, and output audio signals obtained from their frequency and time response.
